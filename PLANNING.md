## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **State Management**: Context API + React Query for server state
- **Routing**: React Router v7 (framework mode)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Yup validation
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Stack

- **Primary**: Supabase Backend-as-a-Service
    - Authentication (including OAuth)
    - PostgreSQL database
    - Real-time subscriptions
    - Object storage
    - Row-level security
- **Extended API**: C# with ASP.NET Core (if needed)
    - Custom business logic
    - Advanced analytics
    - Integration services

### Database Design

- **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL on Supabase
- **Key Entities**: Users, Quizzes, Questions, Choices, Attempts, Results, Notifications
- **Data Strategy**: Soft deletes for audit trail, hard deletes for drafts/notifications

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)
- **Version Control**: GitHub with feature branch workflow
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Supabase Analytics + Vercel Analytics
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry (optional)

## Performance & Quality Requirements

### Performance Targets

- Page load time (P95): ≤ 5 seconds
- UI interaction response (P95): ≤ 300ms
- Auto-marking completion: ≤ 7 seconds

### Accessibility Standards

- WCAG 2.1 Level AA: ≥ 85% compliance
- WCAG 2.1 Level AAA: ≥ 50% compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

### Browser Support

- Chrome, Edge, Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Target: ≥ 90% user coverage

### Security Requirements

- Industry-standard authentication (OAuth, JWT)
- Password hashing with salt/pepper
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement

## Development Methodology

### Agile Approach

- Incremental feature delivery
- User feedback integration
- Flexible development pace
- Feature-based milestone tracking

### Code Quality Standards

- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Unit testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Integration testing
- Code review requirements

### Documentation Strategy

- API documentation (auto-generated)
- Component documentation (Storybook)
- User guides and help pages
- Technical architecture documentation

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Supabase limitations for complex business logic  
**Mitigation**: Plan for C# API extension from early stages

**Risk**: Real-time features performance at scale  
**Mitigation**: Implement efficient data fetching and caching strategies

**Risk**: Complex quiz state management  
**Mitigation**: Design robust state architecture with proper data flow

### Business Risks

**Risk**: Accessibility compliance gaps  
**Mitigation**: Regular accessibility audits and testing with assistive technologies

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities  
**Mitigation**: Security-first development approach with regular audits

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility compliance scores
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Test coverage ≥ 80%

### User Experience Metrics

- User registration completion rate
- Quiz completion rate
- User retention rate
- System reliability (99%+ uptime)

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment and repository
2. Configure Supabase project and database schema
3. Implement authentication foundation
4. Create basic UI component library
5. Develop core quiz management features
